\section*{Reviewer 4}

\paragraph{R4.1} We agree with the reviewer that it would be interesting to compare our work against a PSG if possible. However, doing so
is infeasible because of the focus of the work and practical reasons. Our work focuses on tracking a user's physical activities (like hand
positions and body rollover) and the sleeping environment (like lighting and acoustic events), and we need to achieve these with as little
disruption to the user's normal sleep as possible. A PSG would only track the user's sleep stages. It is not only expensive to buy, but
will also cause significant disruptions to a user's normal sleep. These make it difficult to perform a large-scale experiment across a
long-period of time using PSGs. Instead, we choose to compare our work with Fitbit as its accuracy is shown to be comparable to a PSG.
However, we show that our approach can track more events and lead to a better understand of the sleep quality than Fitbit. We have
clarified and provided a discussion on this in \FIXME{Section xx}. Please see also R4.3. We thank the reviewer for the feedback.

\paragraph{R4.2} We have performed further analysis on our user study per the review feedback. We now show that {\systemname} does help some of
our participants in understanding the causes of poor sleeps. Specifically, our data reveal that the hand position was the reason for
frequent numb arms and nightmares for two of our participants, the sleeping posture and hand position contributed to snoring for another
participant, and the excessive light intensity and frequent noises of the environment led to bad sleeps for a fourth participant. Based on
these findings, we then suggested ways to improve their sleeping habits and a return visit of these users shows that our suggestions helped
to improve these users' sleep quality. The new results and discussion can be found in \FIXME{Section xx}. We have also reworded our claims.


\paragraph{R4.3} We have provided a discussion on the advantages and disadvantages for PSG in \FIXME{Section xx}. See also R1.1. Thanks for the feedback.

\paragraph{R4.4} Please see our response to R1.2 regarding our pilot study.

\paragraph{R4.4} Please refer to R1.3 on how the thresholds of respiration detection are chosen.

\paragraph{R4.5} The volunteers recruited for determining our algorithm parameters are different from those involved in
 evaluation. The details are provided in \FIXME{Section xx} of the revised manuscript. See also R1.4.

 \paragraph{R4.6} Please see our response to R1.5 on how the HMM model is built.
