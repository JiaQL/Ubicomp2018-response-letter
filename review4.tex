\section*{Reviewer 4}

\paragraph{R4.1} We agree with the reviewer that it would be interesting to compare our work against a PSG if possible. However, doing so
is infeasible because of the focus of the work and practical reasons. Our work focuses on tracking a user's physical activities (like hand
positions and body rollover) and the sleeping environment (like lighting and acoustic events), and we need to achieve these with as little
disruption to the user's normal sleep as possible. A PSG would only track the user's sleep stages. It is not only expensive to buy, but
will also cause significant disruptions to a user's normal sleep. These make it difficult to perform a large-scale experiment across a
long-period of time using PSGs. Instead, we choose to compare our work with Fitbit as its accuracy is shown to be comparable to a PSG.
However, we show that our approach can track more events and lead to a better understand of the sleep quality than Fitbit. We have
clarified and provided a discussion on this in \FIXME{Section xx}. Please see also R4.3. We thank the reviewer for the feedback.

\paragraph{R4.2} We have performed further analysis on our user study per the review feedback. Please refer to M2. We have also reworded our
claims. Thank you.


\paragraph{R4.3} We have provided a discussion on the advantages and disadvantages for PSG in \FIXME{Section xx}. See also R1.1. Thanks for the feedback.

\paragraph{R4.4} Please see our response to R1.2 regarding our pilot study.

\paragraph{R4.4} Please refer to R1.3 on how the thresholds of respiration detection are chosen.

\paragraph{R4.5} The volunteers recruited for determining our algorithm parameters are different from those involved in
 evaluation. The details are provided in \FIXME{Section xx} of the revised manuscript. See also R1.4.

 \paragraph{R4.6} Please see our response to R1.5 on how the HMM model is built.
