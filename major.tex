\section*{List of Major Changes}

We respond to the main comments below, noting which reviews they come from.

\paragraph{M1.} We have better highlighted the motivation and scientific contributions of the work in Section 1 and demonstrated that how our work can lead to
a better understanding of the sleep quality in Section 4.2.4.

\paragraph{M2.} We have clarified the aim and better explained the results of our user survey, showing how \systemname can help users
improve their sleep behaviours (all reviewers). This can be found at Section 4.2.4. The revision shows how \systemname helps some of our
participants in understanding the causes of poor sleeps. Specifically, our data reveal that the hand position was the reason for frequent
numb arms and nightmares for two of our participants, the sleeping posture and hand position contributed to snoring for another
participant, and the excessive light intensity and frequent noises of the environment led to bad sleeps for a fourth participant. Based on
these findings, we then suggested ways to improve their sleeping habits and a return visit
of these users shows that our suggestions helped to improve these users' sleep quality.

\paragraph{M3.} We provide discussions on the use of a PSG in Sections 1 and 6 (Reviewers 1, 4). See also R1.1.

\paragraph{M4.} Section 2.1 and Section 3.1 give further details on our experimental setup per reviewer feedback (Reviewers 1, 4, 5). See also R2.2, R2.4, R4.4, R4.6, R5.11.

\paragraph{M5.} We have updated Section 2.4 to include a detailed description of the HMM model (Reviewers 1, 4). See also R1.5.


\paragraph{M6.} We have provided a discussion on scenarios of multiple sleeps, the occurrence of unusual arm positions, etc. This can be
found at Section 5.

\paragraph{M7.} We have made all the minor correction suggested by the reviewers and some others (All reviewers).
