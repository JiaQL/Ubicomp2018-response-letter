\section*{Reviewer 2}
\paragraph{R2.1} Our work focuses on tracking sleep behaviours (like hand positions and respiratory motions) and the sleeping environment
(like lighting and acoustic events), but not sleep stages. Our goal is to help a user to understand poor sleep but not quantify the sleep
quality. We do not compare to medical-grade equipment like PSG due to the scope of the work and for practical reasons (please see also R4.1
and R1.1). This is clarified in \FIXME{Section xx}.

\paragraph{R2.2} Yes, \systemname is a sleep monitoring system for wearable devices. However, it can track a richer set of events
(including body postures, hand positions, body rollover counts, micro-body movements, and acoustic events) that are not supported by
Fitbit. We show that these rich events can help some of our users in understanding the causes of poor sleep and subsequently to improve
their sleep quality (see also M2). We have revised the introduction section to better highlight our contributions. Thanks for the feedback.

\paragraph{R2.3} Our paper presents new algorithms to monitor and detect a range of sleep activities (like body postures, hand positions,
micro-body movements etc.) on wearable devices. Many of these are not supported by Fitbit, a state-of-the-art sleep monitoring system on
wearable devices. We also demonstrate that the tracked events can help users improve their sleep quality. This contribution is now
highlighted in Section 1.
