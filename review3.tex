\section*{Reviewer 3}
\paragraph{R3.1} We agree with the reviewer that the discussion and analysis of the user survey should be improved. As such, we have extended Section 4.2.4
in the revised version to provide new analysis, evidences and discussions, showing how \systemname helps some of our participants in
understanding the cause of poor sleeps and in taking actions to improve their sleeps. Please see also M2.

\paragraph{R3.2} Agree that evidences should be given to demonstrate the benefit of \systemname. This information is now given in Section
4.2.4. Compared to medical equipment like PSG, which tracks physiological signals (e.g., brain waves and electrocardiogram), the sleep
events given by \systemname (e.g., postures, hand positions, body movements etc.), can be easier understood by many people who do not have
a medical background. Furthermore, much of such information is not provided by Fitbit. Please see also M2 on how \systemname help our users
understand and improve their sleep behaviours.
