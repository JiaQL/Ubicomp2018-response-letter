\section*{Reviewer 3}
\paragraph{R3.1} We agree that the discussion and analysis of the user survey should be improved. As such, we have extended Section 4.2.4
in the revised version with new analysis, evidences and discussions, showing how \systemname helps some of our participants in
understanding the cause of poor sleeps and in taking actions to improve their sleeps. Please see also M2.

\paragraph{R3.2} Agree that evidence should be provided to demonstrate the benefit of \systemname. Such information is given in Section
4.2.4. Compared to medical equipment like PSG, which tracks physiological signals, such as brain waves and electrocardiogram, the sleep
events given by \systemname, such as postures, hand positions, body movements etc., can be more easily understood by people who have no
medical background. Much of such information is not provided by Fitbit, the state-of-art commercial-grade sleep monitoring system for
wearable devices. Please see also M2 on how \systemname help our users understand and improve their sleep behaviours.
